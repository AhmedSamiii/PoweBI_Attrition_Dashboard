Welcome to our project repository! This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition and behavior within our organization using Power BI.

Project Highlights
Dimensional Model:
The dimensional model comprises two fact tables:
Attrition Fact Table: This table contains data related to employee attrition, such as reasons for leaving, department, job role, etc.
Employee Behavior Fact Table: This table captures various behavioral metrics of employees, including attendance, performance, involvement, etc.
Additionally, there are two dimension tables:
Date Dimension: This table provides a comprehensive set of dates for analysis, allowing for time-based analysis of attrition and behavior trends.
Employee Dimension: This table holds detailed information about each employee, including demographics, job details, etc.
Brief Description
This project aims to provide insights into employee attrition and behavior patterns within our organization. By leveraging Power BI, we have analyzed data from our dimensional model to identify key factors influencing attrition and employee behavior. The interactive dashboards generated from this analysis enable stakeholders to explore trends, make informed decisions, and implement targeted strategies to improve employee retention and engagement.

Feel free to explore the project files and dashboards to gain a deeper understanding of our findings and recommendations.
