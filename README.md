## Brief Description
This project aims to provide insights into employee attrition and behavior patterns within our organization. By leveraging Power BI, we have analyzed data from our dimensional model to identify key factors influencing attrition and employee behavior. The interactive dashboards generated from this analysis enable stakeholders to explore trends, make informed decisions, and implement targeted strategies to improve employee retention and engagement.

The story behind the dashboard is divided into three main parts:
1. **Company Overview Dashboard:** This dashboard provides an overall snapshot of attrition and behavior metrics across the entire company. Users can get a high-level view of attrition rates, trends, and patterns.
2. **Department Analysis Dashboard:** Users can drill down to specific departments to assess attrition and behavior metrics. This dashboard allows users to identify problematic areas within departments, such as job roles, education levels, and other factors contributing to attrition.
3. **Employee Detail Dashboard:** Users can further drill down to individual employees within each department and job role to analyze their behavior. This dashboard provides detailed insights into employee performance, attendance, involvement, and other behavioral metrics.

## Project Highlights
- **Dimensional Model:**
  - The dimensional model comprises two fact tables: 
    - **Attrition Fact Table:** This table contains data related to employee attrition, such as reasons for leaving, department, job role, etc.
    - **Employee Behavior Fact Table:** This table captures various behavioral metrics of employees, including attendance, performance, involvement, etc.
  - Additionally, there are two dimension tables:
    - **Date Dimension:** This table provides a comprehensive set of dates for analysis, allowing for time-based analysis of attrition and behavior trends.
    - **Employee Dimension:** This table holds detailed information about each employee, including demographics, job details, etc.
